# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.20.0                  # Base numerical operations
ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0           # FFmpeg Python bindings for audio handling

# OpenCV with CUDA interfaces
# Note: The pip version includes CUDA interfaces but may not properly detect CUDA devices
opencv-contrib-python>=4.5.0   # OpenCV with contrib modules (includes CUDA interfaces)

# CUDA acceleration
# CuPy provides GPU-accelerated NumPy operations and is the primary acceleration method
# Install the version that matches your CUDA installation:
cupy-cuda11x>=11.0.0           # For CUDA 11.x (we've tested with CUDA 11.8)
# cupy-cuda12x>=12.0.0         # For CUDA 12.x (uncomment if using CUDA 12.x)
# cupy-cuda10x>=10.0.0         # For CUDA 10.x (uncomment if using CUDA 10.x)

# For systems without CUDA:
# To use CPU-only version, comment out cupy above and use basic opencv instead of contrib
# opencv-python>=4.5.0         # OpenCV without CUDA interfaces
